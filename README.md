# Data-Mining---Python
Repo for any and all data mining projects we create using Python & other data mining tools. Collaborative. Will also act as a repo for storing data analysis results using external tools like Tableau or MS Power BI.

Certain projects should be identifiable by the name of their folder and contain a description in a README file for easier navigation and distinction. 

Run the installRequirements.bat file when included in a projects folder to install all the modules needed to run the relevant program.
